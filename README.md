# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-ML-project-
This is the basic Machine learning project in which I'm finding the credit card fraud detection in different transactions of credit cards. I got the dataset from "Kaggle", I'll share the .csv file alongside the code. I got the dataset, balanced both fraudable dataset and non-fraudable dataset using "Robust Scaler(a method used for scaling features/variables)" and then train the model using "Logistic regression".
That's all!!
